### Classic Hamburger Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 1 lb ground beef (preferably 80% lean)
- 4 hamburger buns
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 4 slices of cheese (optional)
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Onion slices
- Pickles
- Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Patties**: Divide the ground beef into four equal parts and gently shape them into patties. Press a slight indentation into the center of each patty to ensure they cook evenly.
2. **Season the Patties**: Season both sides of the patties with salt and black pepper.
3. **Cook the Patties**: Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
4. **Add the Cheese**: If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking. Cover the skillet to melt the cheese.

    "# Unleash The Swarm - Multi Agent Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing a new proposed way of breaking down extensive agentic workflows- **Swarm**. Originally proposed by OpenAI in their [repo](https://github.com/openai/swarm) and [code research](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/orchestrating_agents), they tackle the limitations of giving a single system prompt + multiple tools to an LLM for complex multi-step *routines* or processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Swarm approach looks at agentic frameworks as **dynamic, context-aware switching between specialized agents to handle complex, multi-domain conversations more effectively.** Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Switching**: The ability to change agents mid-conversation based on the evolving needs of the interaction.\n",
    "2. **Context-Aware**: Maintaining and transferring conversation history between agents, ensuring continuity and coherence.\n",
    "3. **Specialized Agents**: Using focused, domain-specific agents instead of a single generalist agent.\n",
    "4. **Complex, Multi-Domain Conversations**: Addressing the challenge of handling conversations that span multiple topics or require different types of expertise.\n",
    "5. **Improved Effectiveness**: Aiming to provide more appropriate and accurate responses by leveraging specialized knowledge and tools for each part of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, decomposing the task at hand across multiple specialized \"agents\" or \"routines\", orchestrated through the transfer of message history with specialized system prompts and corresponding functions to better execute on overarching plans. As a plus, this allows the dynamic switching between specific workflows, making it easier to specialize or tune specific routines via system prompts or tools."

    "# Routines & Handoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/routines.png\" width=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarm operates with two main concepts in mind: **routines** and **handoffs**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routines** capture the overall flow that you want your agentic structure to follow and complete. For our example, I am going to demonstrate the creation of a meal planning assistant. The routine of this might then be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Understand user's meal planning needs and preferences\n",
    "- Take note of dietary restrictions\n",
    "- Take note of dietary preferences\n",
    "Generate meal ideas based on preferences and restrictions\n",
    "- Discuss the preferences\n",
    "- Take note of agreed upon meals\n",
    "Create recipes for the chosen meals\n",
    "- Find out what the user needs help making\n",
    "- Take note of all recipes needed for those meals\n",
    "Compile a grocery list for all meals\n",
    "- Look at the recipes and meals\n",
    "- Take note of the ingredients needed for these meals\n",
    "Generate a final report summarizing the meal plan, recipes, and grocery list\n",
    "- Determine whether the user is satisfied\n",
    "- Output a final report\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the main issue that we realize here is that within this routine are lots and lots of different operations that need to be executed, which can complicate things. Single prompt + tool language models tend to lose the improved performance that comes with specificity and narrow scopes as their overall routine to follow increases in length or complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the **handoff** comes in. Instead of having that single system prompt and relying on one language model with all the tools to accurately and effectively handle the routine, we can break down each part into a sub-routine. These routines then become their own system prompts and corresponding set of tools, or \"agents\". This allows us to hand off the conversation between these agents and sub-routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Routine 1: Triage and Orchestration\n",
    "- Direct user queries to appropriate specialized agents\n",
    "- Suggest possible actions to the user\n",
    "- Initiate the final report generation when appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "Routine 2: Meal Planning\n",
    "- Gather and note dietary preferences and restrictions\n",
    "- Ideate and suggest diverse meal choices\n",
    "- Record agreed-upon meals (aiming for 3 different meals)\n",
    "\n",
    "Routine 3: Recipe Creation and Grocery List Compilation\n",
    "- Create detailed recipes for chosen meals\n",
    "- Save recipes for future reference\n",
    "- Add required ingredients to the grocery list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking it down and adding this level of specificity allows each sub-routine to be modular and scalable. Instead of having to worry about tuning the overall flow with a large and specific system prompt, you can work on and fine-tune the individual routines that make up the overall goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Handing off the conversation to these different agents at different steps along the routine maintains the context and understanding, but allows our LLM to perform different specialized functions or tasks. This approach enhances the system's ability to handle complex tasks while maintaining focus and efficiency at each stage of the process."

      "- Salt and black pepper to taste\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n",

      "1. **Prepare the Patties**: Divide the ground beef into four equal parts and gently shape them into patties. Press a slight indentation into the center of each patty to ensure they cook evenly.\n",
      "2. **Season the Patties**: Season both sides of the patties with salt and black pepper.\n",
      "3. **Cook the Patties**: Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.\n",
      "4. **Add the Cheese**: If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking. Cover the skillet to melt the cheese.\n",
      "5. **Prepare the Buns**: Toast the hamburger buns in a toaster or on a skillet for a minute or two until slightly crispy.\n",
      "6. **Assemble the Burgers**: Spread ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise on the buns. Layer each with a patty, lettuce, tomato slices, onions, and pickles.\n",

It leverages language models' adherence to system prompts and narrowly defined \"routines\" with specialized tools.
